# Basin

## Scope
Library with abstract concepts related to persistence. 

## Goal
Collect all concepts needed to implement an ORM in this library, then let other libraries implement it (like JPA and JDO in java), also don't pollute final entities. At worst an entity should implement the Persistable interface to get stored. Nothing else should be required
